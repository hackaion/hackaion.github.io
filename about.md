Here I am. Pietro - me - is an evergreen student, emerging from the fiery depths
of [Sicily](https://mustseeplaces.eu/mount-etna-sicily-italy/), currently tempering
himself in the Great North @ Politecnico di Torino.

Passion for learning is what drives me. Recently, I focused my energies on
cybersecurity-related stuff, ranging over Red-Teaming and Blue-Teaming researches
alike, trying to figure out a - slightly - bigger picture of security in this harsh world :)

After CyberChallenge18 IT experience, I play with [these guys](https://pwnthemole.github.io/)
in CTF competitions.
